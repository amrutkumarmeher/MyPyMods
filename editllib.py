                                 it is a module make by AMRUT KUMER MEHER,
                                it can edit any text file by without open it.
            Adding: it has a function called addLineInFile that can add new lines in the text in any text file
            Removing: it has a function called delLineInFile can remove lines in any text file, and in some cases you
                      to remove some line but multiples line looking same as your line that you have to remove so, it
                      has a function called delLineInFil2, this will find the list of lines similar to line that have
                      to remove any remove any particular of them. it require a number that the number of line have to
                      remove from list of simular line.
            Replacing: it has two function called replcLineInFil and replcLineInFil2, replcLineInFil can replace any line
                      from another however other one replcLineInFil2 can replace the line in list of similar line by number
                       of anyparticular line ,same as delLineInFil2.
            searhing: it has a function called searchLineInFile that can search any particular line in file and it position
                      (in number) in file
